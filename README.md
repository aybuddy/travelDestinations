# travelDestinations

Travel Destinations is a web app that allows users to enter in a country they would like to visit and the destinations that one could visit when they visit the country.

A visitor to the app can view the countries listed displayed in the home screen. If a country is clicked, the destinations will show up that have been added by other users.

To add, edit or delete a country or destination, the user needs to be logged in using a google or facebook sign-in.

Once logged in, they are able to add a country and destination of their choice. Users may only edit and delete countries they have added.
